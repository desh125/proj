abstract
due to the high personal and organizational costs associated with safety incidents, it is essential that we understand the trait
predictors of safety behaviors which in turn impact occupational accidents and injuries. this study helps address this need by
assessing the relationship between trait mindfulness and workplace injuries, as well as examining a mediating mechanism (safety
behaviors) and situational moderator (safety climate) of this relationship. using hierarchically nested data from employees within
a large company in the petroleum distribution industry (n = 706 employees within 142 groups), our results suggest that trait
mindfulness is related to workplace injuries, safety compliance, and safety participation and that this relationship between trait
mindfulness and workplace injuries is mediated by safety compliance. moreover, group-level safety climate moderates the effects
of trait mindfulness on safety compliance and safety participation such that the best safety behavior occurs when both safety
climate and trait mindfulness are high. these results indicate that trait mindfulness is an important trait predictor of safety
behaviors and that it is a helpful personal resource necessary for a successful safety-focused organization.

workplace accidents and injuries are crucial issues for <span style="background-color: yellow;">organizations</span> and occupational safety researchers because they
result in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities worldwide. for example, there were 23,147 deaths due to fatal
occupational injuries globally in 2015 (international labour
organization, 2015). according to a study by wiegmann and
shappell (2001), most of those workplace fatal accidents and
injuries were caused by human error. recent research supports
the importance of individual differences in promoting safety at
work: using traits for selection and staffing decisions has been
shown to enhance occupational safety (beus, dhanani, &
mccord, 2015; clarke & robertson, 2005). accordingly, to
help reduce workplace accidents and injuries, it is important to
identify individual differences that influence the likelihood of
engaging in unsafe behaviors (e.g., beus et al., 2015) and
potentially screen out accident-prone employees who tend to
cause safety incidents (clarke & robertson, 2005). due to the
important role of situational awareness in the safety process
(stanton, chambers, & piggott, 2001), employee mindfulness
is likely a trait that is particularly relevant for promoting workplace safety. zhang and wu (2014) suggested that mindfulness, serving as an individual difference, was associated with
employee safety behaviors. building off of this preliminary
work on mindfulness and safety, we seek to better understand
how, why, and when trait mindfulness influences occupational
injuries.

the little research on mindfulness and occupational safety
that has been published supports the importance of trait mindfulness in the safety process: trait mindfulness has been found
to be related to increased safety behaviors (valley & stallones,
2017; zhang, ding, li, & wu, 2013; zhang & wu, 2014) and
decreased workarounds, cognitive failures, and safety failures
(dierynck, leroy, savage, & choi, 2017; valley & stallones,
2017). from this research, mindfulness has emerged as an
important individual difference factor that contributes to safety outcomes above and beyond commonly used individual
difference selection criteria such as intelligence and conscientiousness (zhang & wu, 2014). specifically, zhang and wu
(2014), using a sample of power plant control operators in the
nuclear industry in china, found that trait mindfulness was
related to higher safety compliance and safety participation.
they further identified intelligence and experience as individual difference moderators on the relationship between mindfulness and safety behavior: the highest safety behavior was
observed for people who were high on trait mindfulness and
high on intelligence and job experience. the work of zhang
and wu (2014) provides initial support for the importance of
trait mindfulness in occupational safety.
however, before trait mindfulness can be successfully incorporated into safety selection and training programs, we
need to better understand the situational factors that best support mindful employees and the impact of mindfulness on
more distal safety outcomes (e.g., injuries). building off of
the findings from zhang and wu (2014), the current paper
aims to make three primary contributions. first, we aim to
replicate the positive relationship between trait mindfulness
and safety behaviors within a different population and industry and using a different—and shorter—measure of trait mindfulness. second, in order to gain a clearer understanding of the
mechanism that underlies the relationship between trait mindfulness and workplace injuries, in line with self-determination
theory (deci & ryan, 1985), we expand zhang and wu’s
(2014) findings and examine the mediating role of safety behaviors underlying the relationship between trait mindfulness
and workplace injuries. as a result, our study advances our
understanding of both the proximal (safety behaviors) and
distal (occupational injuries) impacts of trait mindfulness on
employee safety. through this, we hope to show not only that
trait mindfulness is related to higher safety behavior enactment, but that it is also related to safety behaviors in a way
that is impactful for reducing occupational injuries. third,
given that trait mindfulness refers to an individual attention
to and awareness of present environments/events, we extend
the findings by zhang and wu (2014) to examine situations
under which the different levels of trait mindfulness in safety
behaviors is strengthened or weakened. specifically, drawing
on social information processing theory (salancik & pfeffer,
1978), we examine a group-level contextual moderator, safety
climate, referring to a perception of safety priority in a group
(zohar, 2000), on the relationships between trait mindfulness
and safety behaviors. overall, we propose a cross-level moderated mediation model (edwards & lambert, 2007; preacher,
rucker, & hayes, 2007) that is depicted in fig. 1.
by looking at the role of safety climate in these relationships, we can provide better recommendations for both
supporting mindful employees and promoting the success of
safety climate interventions. although recent research supports a relationship between trait mindfulness and safetyrelated behaviors and outcomes (dierynck et al., 2017;
valley & stallones, 2017; zhang & wu, 2014), we continue
to know relatively little about the contextual boundary conditions of personality/safety outcome relationships. for instance, to what extent can contextual factors, such as positive
safety climate, compensate for personality traits that render
certain employees more risk-, injury-, and accident-prone?
in other words, employees who have different types of personal characteristics may respond differentially to a contextual
factor such as safety climate (beus et al., 2015; clarke &
robertson, 2005). thus, more work is needed to understand
the contextual boundary conditions, such as safety climate, of
the mindfulness/safety relationship.
trait mindfulness
trait mindfulness refers to a quality of consciousness and is
defined as “a receptive attention to and awareness of present
events and experience” (brown & ryan, 2003). trait mindfulness reflects disposition-based differences in mindfulness
across people (brown & ryan, 2003). specifically, a mindful
person tends to pay attention to what is happening in the
moment, including both internal (e.g., thoughts or perception)
and external stimuli (e.g., physical environments or social
interaction) (brown, ryan, & creswell, 2007). meta-analytic
research has indicated that trait mindfulness—which is empirically distinct from the big five personality variables—
provides incremental variance, particularly above and beyond
consciousness, in individuals’ psychological well-being and
behaviors (giluk, 2009). for instance, research has found that
trait mindfulness is positively related to vitality, positive affect, life satisfaction, and sleep quality (e.g., allen & kiburz,
2012; brown & ryan, 2003; howell, digdon, & buro, 2010;
howell, digdon, buro, & sheptycki, 2008; weinstein,
brown, & ryan, 2009) as well as is negatively related to
anxiety, depression, aggression, suppression, and hostility
(e.g., howell et al., 2008; tamagawa et al., 2013). a recent
review by good et al. (2016) integrating mindfulness research
into the work domain suggests that mindfulness may play a
significant role in influencing behaviors in the work context.
in line with this, recent research suggests that mindfulness is
linked to work behaviors and workplace outcomes such as
2
j bus psychol (2021) 36:1–15
task performance and safety behaviors (glomb, duffy, bono,
& yang, 2011; zhang et al., 2013; zhang & wu, 2014).
self-determination theory and mindfulness
self-determination theory (sdt) posits that individuals have
an inherent tendency to develop and grow toward their fullest
capacity (deci & ryan, 1985). as such, individuals tend to
seek challenges, strive for their own interests, and pursue social connections to ensure ongoing psychological growth, to
uphold integrity, and to maintain their well-being (ryan &
deci, 2000). sdt postulates that the satisfaction of the needs
for autonomy, relatedness, and competence is an energizing
state that leads to psychological health and well-being (kasser
& ryan, 1999; la guardia, ryan, couchman, & deci, 2000)
and that social contexts and interpersonal relationships provide support of these three basic needs. specifically, conditions where individuals’ psychological needs are met facilitate
personal growth, health, and well-being; conditions where individuals’ psychological needs are not met hinder motivation
and ultimately lead to negative psychological and physical
health symptoms (deci, connell, & ryan, 1989). in general,
sdt suggests a link between the psychological needs and
motivation which, in turn, influences individuals’ behaviors
(gagné & deci, 2005; ryan & deci, 2000).
research on mindfulness suggests that the key component
of mindfulness is attention/awareness (brown & ryan, 2003;
good et al., 2016; levesque & brown, 2007). particularly,
mindful people report high awareness of internal (e.g.,
thoughts and emotions) and external streams (e.g., sensation)
that happen in the present moment (brown et al., 2007).
according to sdt, clear awareness is vital to satisfy and clarify our basic psychological needs (ryan, huta, & deci, 2008).
through its impact on attentional stability, control, and efficiency, mindfulness is associated with increased selfregulation and reduced automaticity which, in turn, influence
subsequent behaviors that are consistent with an individual’s
needs and values (good et al., 2016; deci & ryan, 1985).
sdt, therefore, provides a theoretical foundation to demonstrate why mindfulness may be related to safety behaviors and
workplace injuries.
trait mindfulness and safety outcomes
workplace injuries
research on mindfulness suggests that mindfulness can impact attention and motivation, and can particularly enable employees to effectively regulate thoughts, emotion, and behaviors (brown et al., 2007; good et al., 2016; masicampo &
baumeister, 2007). that is, mindfulness is related to enhanced
attentional awareness as well as autonomous regulation and
volition of a behavior (ryan et al., 2008). zooming in on the
attentional awareness component, research has demonstrated
that mindful people tend to make more accurate judgements,
display high problem-solving abilities, and have high task
performance (dane & brummel, 2014; kiken & shook,
2011). herndon (2008) indicated that trait mindfulness is associated with decreased cognitive failures (e.g., distraction,
overlooking and carelessness) which, in turn, lead to high task
performance and fewer accidents. trait mindfulness, therefore, is likely associated, directly, with decreased safety
safety behaviors

incidents due to this increased risk perception accuracy and
risk avoidance (herndon, 2008). based on this, we propose
the following hypothesis:
hypothesis 1: trait mindfulness will be directly negatively
related to workplace injuries.
safety behavior
safety behaviors comprise two separate groups of behavior
that contribute to occupational safety (christian, bradley,
wallace, & burke, 2009; neal & griffin, 2006): (a) safety
compliance refers to required behaviors that individuals display to keep a workplace safe, such as wearing helmets and
following safety procedures, and (b) safety participation refers
to extra-role behaviors that aim to develop a safe environment
and improve workplace safety, such as helping co-workers
with safety-related issues and attending voluntary safety meetings. employees in high-risk industries and professions need
to value occupational safety and tend to regulate their safety
behaviors (i.e., safety compliance and safety participation)
(kao, spitzmueller, cigularov, & wu, 2016; probst,
brubaker, & barsotti, 2008). trait mindfulness has been
shown to be an important component of enhanced safety behaviors (zhang & wu, 2014).
through self-reflection and self-awareness, individuals are
able to recognize their own values and needs and make those
values and needs consistent with their behavior (schultz &
ryan, 2015). when mindful people are aware of or pay attention to what is really occurring at a specific moment, they are
in a better position to make their own meaningful choices and
to act in a goal-directed manner. in contrast, when employees
have limited regulatory capacity (low mindfulness), they tend
to participate in unexpected organizational behaviors (e.g.,
risky decision-making, workplace deviance, unsafe behavior,
and interpersonal conflicts) (christian & ellis, 2011; kao
et al., 2016). in a similar vein, the degree of attention (i.e.,
mindfulness) influences safety-oriented behaviors.
accordingly, drawing on sdt (deci & ryan, 1985) and the
findings from zhang and wu (2014), we expect that trait
mindfulness is associated with increased safety behaviors.
trait mindfulness and workplace injuries: indirect
effect through safety behaviors
we propose that trait mindfulness—in addition to the direct
relationship between trait mindfulness and employee
injuries—also influences injuries indirectly through increased
safety behavior. given that research has found a positive relationship between mindfulness and safety behaviors, we expect
it to relate to distal safety outcomes (i.e., workplace injuries)
through these proximal safety relationships (i.e., increased
safety behaviors). as safety behaviors have been consistently
identified as a key antecedent of decreased workplace injuries
(e.g., burke & signal, 2010), it is likely that trait mindfulness
influences the occurrences of workplace injuries both directly
and indirectly (via safety behaviors). through the tenants of
sdt, mindfulness can work to increase self-regulation and
autonomous motivation for enacting safety behaviors, which
can decrease workplace accidents and injuries (zohar, huang,
lee, & robertson, 2015). the more safety compliance and
safety participation employees engage in (i.e., adherence to
safety rules and regulations and participation in safe activities), the less likely it will be that they will experience a negative safety incident and experience an occupational injury
(christian et al., 2009). accordingly, in line with sdt, we
argue that trait mindfulness is associated with workplace injuries through safety behaviors. therefore, we hypothesize the
following:
hypothesis 2: trait mindfulness will be indirectly related to
workplace injuries via safety behaviors: (a) safety compliance
and (b) safety participation.
the contextual moderator of safety climate
safety climate, which refers to the shared employee perceptions of organizational safety policies, procedures, and practices, can have a significant influence on occupational safety
(griffin & neal, 2000; zohar, 2000). safety climate thus
serves as a social-cognitive construct, part of group-level epistemology (e.g., collective sense-making; zohar, 2000; zohar
& luria 2004), in which employees interpret and make sense
of their <span style="background-color: yellow;">organizations</span> in regards to occupational safety norms
and expectations. given that safety climate reflects the priority
of safety and the specific safety-related behaviors likely to be
supported and rewarded, the shared perception of safety climate is derived from cues based on managerial policies and
practice (zohar, 2000). in strong safety climate contexts, <span style="background-color: yellow;">organizations</span> have safety goals (i.e., decreasing workplace accidents and injuries) and strategies and means of attaining
these goals. a strong safety climate is associated with strong
perceptions of safety values and priority among employees in
the workplace (zohar, 2003). moreover, organizational climate is generally related to specific policies, procedures, and
practices such that perceptions of an organizational climate
can guide employees and inform them of expectations for
desirable behavior that should be performed (schneider,
1990). due to this, high safety climates likely bolster the impact of employee safety predictors on safety behavior by providing contextual cues to the employee that safe behaviors are
prioritized and expected. in fact, safety climate serves contextual boundary conditions that can influence the effect of individual factors (e.g., safety knowledge) on safety behaviors
(e.g., jiang, yu, li, & li, 2010).
drawing on social information processing (sip) theory
(salancik & pfeffer 1978), individual perception and
4
j bus psychol (2021) 36:1–15
behaviors are shaped by social information cues, such as job
requirements and expectations, from social contexts. thus,
individuals tend to rely on the information acquired from their
social environments to behave accordingly. given that mindful employees demonstrate high awareness of situational cues
(i.e., increased attentional awareness) which relates to safety
behaviors (zhang & wu, 2014), these employees who work in
an environment with a strong safety climate can receive salient
information about the value of workplace safety, which may
further strengthen their safety behaviors. sip theory posits that
the combination of the social context and the awareness of
consequences is important to influence employees’ workrelated behaviors (ferguson & barry, 2011; salancik &
pfeffer, 1978). therefore, we expect a multiplicative effect
of trait mindfulness and safety behaviors on workplace injuries. specifically, we expect the effect of trait mindfulness on
safety behaviors is more positive when safety climate is stronger than when it is weaker: in workplace settings with stronger
safety climate, there is more likely to be strong situational cues
promoting safety and mindful individuals will be more likely
to pick up on and act on these cues. therefore, we hypothesize
the following:
hypothesis 3: safety climate will moderate the relationship
between trait mindfulness and safety behaviors: (a) safety
compliance and (b) safety participation. specifically, the relationship between trait mindfulness and safety behaviors will
be stronger when safety climate is strong compared to when
safety climate is weak.
in line with sdt and sip theories, it is also expected that
the indirect effect of trait mindfulness on workplace injuries is
stronger for employees with a stronger sense of safety climate.
mindful employees, who display high awareness of and attention to contextual cues, with a strong shared perception of
safety climate, can clearly identify the safety-related policies,
practices, and procedures, as well as the safety-related behaviors that are rewarded, supported, valued, and expected by the
organization (hofmann, morgeson, & gerras, 2003). if safety
is emphasized, mindful employees with a strong sense of safety climate have fewer automatic mental processes and a greater present awareness of safety which may be relate to decreased frequencies of workplace injuries (through increased
safety behaviors). through determining the discrepancy between the current experience and the expected safety goals,
employees manage and regulate displayed behaviors to be
consistent with their perception of safety climate.
accordingly, we propose that strong safety climate is likely
to strengthen the indirect relationship between trait mindfulness and workplace injuries. thus, we hypothesize the
following:
hypothesis 4: safety climate will moderate the indirect
effect of trait mindfulness on workplace injuries (via employee safety compliance and safety participation). specifically,
the indirect relationship of trait mindfulness with workplace
injuries via safety compliance and safety participation will be
stronger when safety climate is strong compared to when safety climate is weak—where the worst safety outcomes would
be experienced with low levels of both mindfulness and safety
climate.
method
participants and procedure
hierarchically nested data (i.e., employees nested within
branch offices of a company) were collected from employees
within a large petroleum distribution company in southern
u.s. this company provides midstream services including
pipeline operations, transportation, storage, and marketing of
petroleum products. web-based surveys were administered to
employees via a survey link embedded within an email message. the survey took approximately 10–20 min to complete.
prior to survey administration, the researchers informed the
participants of the research purpose and guaranteed the confidentiality of their responses. only aggregate data were presented back to the organization; neither supervisors nor the
organization were provided access to the employees’ responses. to encourage participation, two additional reminder
emails were sent to non-responders 4 days and 2 days before
the survey closed. the survey was open for a total of nine full
business days. we invited 840 full-time employees to participate in the survey. finally, 706 complete responses (84%
response rate), representing 142 work units (i.e., branch offices), were obtained. the majority of the participant were
male (85.1 %, sd = .36), average age was 44.89 years (sd
= 10.69), and average job tenure with the organization was
8.32 years (sd = 8.99).
measures
with the exception of the control variables and injuries, the
participants responded to each of the following items using a
5-point likert-type response scale ranging from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
trait mindfulness trait mindfulness was assessed using a fiveitem mindful attention and awareness scale (brown & ryan,
2003). example items were “i find myself doing things without paying attention” and “i do jobs or tasks automatically,
without being aware of what i’m doing.” this scale has been
used in a wide array of populations and has demonstrated
strong psychometric properties and validity inferences
(carlson & brown, 2005; cordon & finney, 2008;
mackillop & anderson, 2007). cronbach’s alpha for internal
consistency reliability for this scale was .90.
5
j bus psychol (2021) 36:1–15
safety compliance safety compliance was assessed using 2
items adapted from griffin and neal (2000). these items were
selected to match the characteristics of the company and asked
about the individual’s safety compliance using the following
items: “i use all necessary safety equipment to do my job” and
“i use the correct safety procedures for carrying out my job.”
due to the limited number of items, the correlation was calculated to evaluate the reliability (r = .86).
safety participation safety participation was assessed using 4
items adapted from griffin and neal (2000). these items
asked about the individual’s safety participation using the following sample items: “i put in extra effort to improve the
safety of the workplace” and “i voluntarily carry out tasks or
activities that help to improve workplace safety.” responses
to the invert items were reverse-scored and averaged with
other items, so that higher scale scores reflected more positive
safety participation. cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .87.
safety climate safety climate was assessed using 14 items
from zohar and luria (2005) to match with organizational
needs and occupational characteristics. we asked employees
to evaluate safety climate based on their perception at their
branch offices of the company. example items were “this
office tries to continually improve safety levels in each department” and “this office provides employees with a lot of information on safety issues.” cronbach’s alpha for this scale
was .95. scores were aggregated across work group members
to form a group-level safety climate score [icc(1) = .17 and
icc(2) = .50]. supporting aggregation, average rwg value was
.95, indicating adequate agreement among members within
groups (huang et al., 2013; james, demaree, & wolf, 1984).
although the icc(2) value for safety climate is relatively low,
research supports using multilevel analyses when variables,
such as safety climate, are theoretically defined as grouplevel constructs and the average rwg indicates good agreement
(chen & bliese, 2002).
workplace injuries workplace injuries were measured by 11
items from kao et al.’s (2016) injury scale, which represents
the most common workplace injuries in the construction occupation based on the bureau of labor statistics occupational
injury and illness classification manual (oiics; bureau of
labor statistics, 2012). one of the benefits of a self-report
injury measure is that it is less likely that injuries are
underreported using confidential self-reports to noncompany personnel compared to official company injury records which, due to employee underreporting and lack of injury disclosure, may not accurately document all injuries that
occurred (e.g., probst, 2015; probst et al., 2008). participants
were asked to indicate the frequency of the occurrence of
specific injuries (i.e., strains or sprains; burns, fractured bone;
dislocated joint; falls, slips, or trips at same level; contact with
chemicals; contact with electricity; contact with thermal extremes; struck against or struck by a person or an object; had
particles or objects enter into the eyes; caught in, under, or
between machines/equipment; open wound, cut, puncture, or
infection of the wound; and abrasions, scratches, or bruises) in
the past 6 months on a 5-point scale (1 = never, 5 = frequently). prior research supports the use of a 6-month timeframe
because it increases the likelihood that participants remember
the frequency and severity of workplace injuries
(halbesleben, 2010). this is also in alignment with
dormann and griffin’s (2015) recommendations for the use
of time lags shorter than a year to maximize measurement
precision and stability. finally, the frequency of workplace
injuries was accumulated from these 11 items.
control variables we controlled for gender, age, job tenure,
and education levels that could be related to employees’safety
behaviors and workplace injuries in all analyses (åkerstedt &
kecklund, 2001; chen, 2009; lourens, vissers, & jessurun,
1999; lu & yang, 2011).
analytic strategy
due to the data in the present study comprising a multilevel
structure, we examined direct, indirect, moderating, and moderated mediating effects through hierarchical modeling techniques
(raudenbush & bryk, 2002). first, we conducted a series of
multilevel confirmatory factor analyses (cfas) to examine the
dimensionality and discriminant validity of our measures in the
present study. second, to test employee-level direct effects
(hypothesis 1) and indirect effects (hypothesis 2), we employed
random effect models by applying hierarchical linear modeling
(hlm; raudenbush & bryk, 2002), which allows us to estimate
each coefficient in the entire covariance matrix by default.
moreover, the recommended bootstrapping approach was used
to estimate the indirect effect of trait mindfulness on workplace
injuries (via safety behaviors) (mackinnon, lockwood, &
williams, 2004; preacher & hayes, 2008). last, we tested the
group-level moderating effect (hypothesis 3) by means of hlm
(raudenbush & bryk, 2002) and examined the moderated mediation effect (hypothesis 4) through the multilevel path analysis
(bauer, preacher, & gil, 2006). to alleviate multicollinearity
concerns, all employee-level variables (i.e., trait mindfulness,
safety compliance, and safety participation) were person-mean
centered to obtain unbiased estimates of the intra-individual-level
hypotheses (hypotheses 1 and 2) and, the group-level variable,
safety climate, was grand-mean centered (hypotheses 3 and 4).

mindfulness was negatively correlated with work-related injuries (r = − .13, p < .01) and was positively related to safety
compliance (r = .25, p < .01) and safety participation (r = .17,
p < .01). these bivariate results provided preliminary support
for hypotheses 1 and 2.
confirmatory factor analyses
we applied dyer, hanges, and hall (2005) approach of multilevel confirmatory factor analyses (cfa) to verify the distinctiveness of employee-level and group-level factors.
consistent with our anticipations, a five-factor model (i.e.,
trait mindfulness, safety compliance, safety participation,
workplace injuries at employee level, and safety climate at
group level) indicated a reasonably adequate fit (χ2 (280) =
706.75, p < .001; rmsea = .046; cfi = .90; tli = .89;
srmr within = .07; srmr between = .05; see table 2) and
had a significantly better fit than a four-factor model in which
safety compliance and safety participation loaded on one factor (i.e., safety behaviors) (χ2 (283) = 936.75, p < .001; δχ2
(3) = 230.00, p < .001; rmsea = .06; cfi = .85; tli = .83;
srmr within = .07; srmr between = .05), and a three-factor
model in which trait mindfulness, safety compliance, and safety participation loaded on one factor (χ2 (285) = 1675.72, p <
.001; δχ2 (5) = 968.97, p < .001; rmsea = .08; cfi = .67;
tli = .63; srmr within = .10; srmr between = .05).
accordingly, based on the above positive evidence for discriminant validity, we proceeded to use these five measures
as proposed for examining our hypotheses.
given that the data were collected from the same source,
we proactively conducted the cfa marker technique suggested by williams, hartman, and cavazotte (2010) to examine the presence and influence of common method variance
(cmv; podsakoff, mackenzie, lee, & podsakoff, 2003). we
selected a measure of the perception of belongingness, which
is related to occupational safety (geller, roberts, & gilmore,
1996), as a marker variable measured with an eight-item scale
of malone, pillow, and osman (2012). following the suggestions of williams et al. (2010), a five-factor model was initially estimated, including an employee-level cfa model and the
marker variable. second, a baseline model was estimated
where we fixed the correlation between the marker variable
and the other study variables at zero; additionally, we set the
value of factor loadings and the error terms of the marker
variable to those values estimated from the cfa model with
the marker variable in the first step. third, a constrained model
(method c model) was assessed that refers to the fixed factor
loadings from the marker variable to all indicators of the cfa
model equally. if the constrained model performs better than
the baseline model, the effects of cmv are probably present.
the results showed that the chi-square difference between the
method c model and baseline model is insignificant (method
c model: χ2(413) = 1824.15, p < .001; baseline model:
χ2(414) = 1827.86, p < .001; δχ2(1) = 3.71, p = .05), thus
indicating that cmv likely was not high and did not bias the
current study’s research results.
testing employee-level direct and indirect effects
table 3 presents the coefficient estimates of employee-level
main effects for hypothesis 1. hypothesis 1 proposed a direct
negative relationship between trait mindfulness and workrelated injuries. consistent with our expectation, trait mindfulness was negatively associated with work-related injuries
(γ = − .05, se = .02, p < .01), indicating that 7% of the
explainable variation in workplace injuries was explained by

trait mindfulness. replicating the findings by zhang and wu
(2014), we also found support for a positive relationship between trait mindfulness and safety behaviors: trait mindfulness was positively related to safety compliance (γ = .28, se
= .04, p < .001) and safety participation (γ = .21, se = .05, p <
.001). these results indicate that 13% of the variance in safety
compliance and that 12% of the variance in safety participation was explained by trait mindfulness. that is, employees
with higher levels of trait mindfulness reported higher levels
of safety compliance and safety participation.
hypothesis 2 proposed that there would be an indirect effect of trait mindfulness on work-related injuries through safety behaviors: (a) safety compliance and (b) safety participation. after controlling for both safety compliance and safety
participation, the effect of trait mindfulness on workplace injuries became lower (γ = − .04, se = .02, p = .01; see table 3),
indicating that 15% of the variance in workplace injuries was
explained by all employee-level factors. to further assess the
significance of the indirect effect, we applied the
bootstrapping approach to estimate the indirect effects of trait
mindfulness on workplace injuries (preacher & hayes, 2008).
the bootstrapped unstandardized indirect effect of − .02
through safety compliance was significant based on its 95%
ci [− .027, − .008] and the indirect effect of − .002 through
safety participation was not significant based on its 95% ci [−
.004, .009]. these results indicate that employees’ trait mindfulness had a negative effect on work-related injuries that was
partially explained by their safety compliance behaviors, providing partial support for hypothesis 2.
examining cross-level moderating effects of safety
climate
hypothesis 3 proposed that safety climate as a group-level
factor would moderate the relationship between trait mindfulness and safety behaviors (a. safety compliance and b. safety
participation). results showed significant cross-level interaction effects on safety compliance (γ = .29, se = .12, p = .02;
see table 4) and safety participation (γ = .27, se = .13, p =
.04; see table 4). this indicates that safety climate explains
9% of the within-group variance and 42% of the betweengroup variance in predicting safety compliance and 1% of

the within-group variance and 55% of the between-group variance in predicting safety participation. moreover, as indicated
by simple slope tests (aiken & west, 1991), both relationships
between trait mindfulness and safety compliance and safety
participation were stronger when safety climate was strong (t
= 5.75, p < .001; t = 4.12, p < .001), compared to when safety
climate was weak (t = 2.84, p = .010; t = 1.57, p = .12; see
figs. 2 and 3). thus, hypotheses 3a and 3b were supported.
to test moderated mediation effects (hypothesis 4), we
applied bauer et al.’s (2006) approach to estimate the conditional indirect effect of trait mindfulness on work-related
injuries via safety behaviors at high levels (+ 1 standard deviation) and low levels (− 1 standard deviation) of safety climate. results indicated that both the indirect effects of trait
mindfulness on workplace injuries (via safety compliance) at
the high level and the low level of safety climate were not
significant (estimate = .05, se = .06, p = .47; estimate = −
.01, se = .03, p = .63). the bootstrapping results revealed that
both indirect effects through safety compliance at the high
level and the low level of safety climate were not significant
based on the 95% cis including zero [− .06, .15; − .06, .03].

workplace injuries (via safety participation) at the high level
and the low level of safety climate were not significant (estimate = .06, se = .07, p = .43; estimate = − .04, se = .05, p =
.51). the bootstrapping results indicated that the indirect effects through safety participant at the high level and the low
level of safety climate were not significant based on the 95%

hypothesis 4 was not supported.
discussion
we examined role of trait mindfulness as a predictor of workplace injuries; assessed the mediating mechanism, safety behavior, through which mindfulness is related to safety outcomes; and examined the moderating role of a group-level
conditional factor, safety climate, on these relationships.
overall, our results support our hypotheses: trait mindfulness
is directly associated with workplace injuries, safety compliance, and safety participation and is indirectly related to workplace injuries through safety compliance. the direct effects of
trait mindfulness on safety compliance and safety participation were found to be moderated by safety climate such that
the most safety behaviors occurred when employees had high
trait mindfulness and were embedded within groups with a
strong safety climate.
theoretical implications
overall, our results support mindfulness as an individual difference tool that employees can utilize to, proximally, improve
safety behaviors and, distally, improve safety outcomes (i.e.,
occupational injuries). this extends the reach of the literature
on the benefits of mindfulness to include occupational injuries
and provides information on a mechanism (safety compliance)
through which mindfulness is related to injuries. in addition,
drawing on sdt (deci & ryan, 1985), the positive relationship of mindfulness on safety behaviors that we found within
our study replicates, within a different occupational context,
the findings of zhang and wu (2014) and bolsters prior research findings regarding the positive influence of mindfulness on job performance in general (e.g., dane & brummel,
2014; glomb et al., 2011). sdt provides a theoretical rationale that posits that mindfulness is related to increased awareness of and attention to the current cues which can promote
response to individual needs and influence subsequent behaviors. in tandem with the growing research on mindfulness in
the workplace (e.g., dane, 2011), our results help to establish
mindfulness squarely within the occupational domain as a
personal capacity that shows promise in helping employees
and <span style="background-color: yellow;">organizations</span>.
in addition to replicating the trait mindfulness–safety behavior relationship identified by zhang and wu (2014), we
apply sdt to expand on their work in three important ways:
first, we examine the relationships between mindfulness with
both safety behaviors and self-rated safety outcomes: accidents/injuries. our results, supporting the indirect effect of
mindfulness on accidents/injuries through safety compliance
lend further support for the utility of mindfulness in <span style="background-color: yellow;">organizations</span> as something that can influence both employee behaviors as well as more distal organizational outcomes with important implications for employee health and organizational
financial success. our examination of safety behavior as a
mediator adds empirical support for the theoretical rationale
of how mindfulness is related to workplace injuries. second,
while zhang and wu (2014) assessed individual difference
moderators, to, we integrate sdt (deci & ryan, 1985) and
sip theories (salancik & pfeffer, 1978) to examine the

influence of the interaction between individual and grouplevel contextual factors (trait mindfulness and safety climate)
on safety behaviors and injuries. in combination, our results
support the notion that trait mindfulness interacts with both
individual (zhang & wu, 2014) and organizational factors
(current study) to influence employee safety behaviors.
finally, we examine these relationships within the contracting
realm of the energy industry; this expands generalizability of
the role of mindfulness in safety beyond control room operators of energy power plants to a wider range of safety critical
jobs.
although safety climate is consistently identified in safety
research as a significant factor of increased safety behaviors,
our results suggest that low mindfulness may limit the beneficial effects of safety climate. one explanation for this could
be that for safety climate to be an effective driver of safety
behaviors, employees need to attend to and act on the situational cues that are promoting safety. within this framework,
although the environment may be strongly supporting safety,
an individual is unlikely to act in accordance with the climate
if their situational awareness is low. therefore, mindfulness,
through its link to attentional awareness and self-regulation,
may be necessary for safety climate to motivate employee
behavior. future research looking deeper into the mechanisms
of these relationships is needed; however, our results suggest
that interventions designed to increase safety behaviors should
include both mindfulness and safety climate components to
optimize effectiveness.
practical implications
our findings highlight the importance of employee trait mindfulness in safety behaviors and accidents/injuries. specifically,
when embedded within work groups with strong safety climate, trait mindfulness was shown to be associated with increased safety behaviors and decreased accidents/injuries.
while trait mindfulness is commonly considered a dispositional individual difference variable (glomb et al., 2011), trait
mindfulness can be improved through training (carmody,
reed, kristeller, & merriam, 2008; chambers, lo, & allen,
2008). given the high costs associated with safety incidents
(e.g., bls, 2015), developing mindfulness may be a way for
employees and employers to support safety behaviors and a
decreased likelihood of accidents/injuries. the malleability of
trait mindfulness through intervention, in conjunction with
our findings, makes trait mindfulness an important individual
difference variable for both selection and training to help optimize employee safety.
our findings—in conjunction with the findings from
zhang and wu (2014) and research supporting the relationship between mindfulness and employee performance (e.g.,
dane & brummel, 2014; glomb et al., 2011; zhang et al.,
2013)—suggest that trait mindfulness may be a useful
criterion for selection in safety-critical workplaces. trait
mindfulness is easy to measure via a short self-report questionnaire. the combined results of our study and zhang and
wu’s (2014) study suggest that the mindfulness/safety behavior relationship generalizes across longer (walach et al., 2006;
zhang et al., 2013) and shorter (brown & ryan, 2003) scales
as well as across cultural (china and the usa) and industry
settings (nuclear plants and oil and gas industries).
furthermore, our moderation results suggest that the relationship between trait mindfulness and safety behavior is stronger
when employees are embedded in teams with higher safety
climates. from a selection perspective, this suggests that in
work groups that have high safety climate, mindfulness may
be a particularly impactful individual difference factor to select to promote safety behavior.
limitations and future research
there are limitations to this study that should be discussed as
well as several supplementary directions for research that will
help make this line of inquiry more robust. to begin with, all
measures were assessed at a single time period. our results
suggest that there is a relationship between trait mindfulness
and safety behaviors and, ultimately, injuries. however, due to
the use of a single measurement time point, the directionality
of the model and mediation mechanism cannot be fully demonstrated without further, longitudinal support of how trait
mindfulness is related to occupational safety over time. yet,
while longitudinal examination of these relationships is a
needed next step in this area, we believe that our study provides important preliminary evidence of these relationships
and that the directionality proposed is well supported by theory and past research. for example, trait mindfulness is a
dispositional characteristic that, by nature, is stable over time
(brown & ryan, 2003). this supports the use of trait mindfulness as a predictor in our model. similarly, the temporal
relationship between safety behaviors and injuries is well documented using longitudinal methods (e.g., neal & griffin,
2006). taken together, although we were not able to assess
the temporal structure of our hypotheses, our trait-behavioroutcome proposed model is well supported by management
theory and prior longitudinal research. our study demonstrated that these constructs are related to each other; past research
and theory supports the validity of the directional relationships
proposed in our model.
our study also relies upon the use of self-report measures to
assess the study variables. self-report data can introduce common method variance (podsakoff et al., 2003; spector, 2006).
although future research should incorporate supervisor ratings of subordinate safety behavior and objective safety outcome data to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of
mindfulness on the safety process, we believe that self-report
methods are appropriate for assessing our research question
11
j bus psychol (2021) 36:1–15
for five primary reasons: first, trait mindfulness and safety
climate are commonly assessed using self-report methods
and are conceptually defined as personal perceptions of the
self (mindfulness) or environment (climate) that are best measured using self-report. mindfulness involves internal mental
processes and attention, so the employees themselves are the
most appropriate source for measuring mindfulness. safety
climate is conceptualized as a group-level aggregation of individual employees’ perceptions, so safety climate is best
assessed by asking the group members about how they perceive the prioritization of safety in their organization.
furthermore, by aggregating these individual perceptions to
a group level, we minimize the impact of any individual’s selfreport-based biases. in addition, the measure of injuries used
in the current study includes minor injuries that may not be
part of a formal safety reporting system. by asking individuals
about their injuries instead of relying on organizational records, we likely captured a greater number of small injuries
that would not have been reported formally.
second, the relationship between safety behavior and objective measures of injuries and accidents is well established
in previous safety research (e.g., neal & griffin, 2006;
hofmann & morgeson 1999). due to the established relationship between safety behavior and accidents/injuries using
multi-method measurements, it is unlikely that the relationships we found are due solely to common method biases.
third, we rely on previously used measures with strong validity evidence and our results provide support for the reliability
and factor structure of the measures used. this provides support for the construct validity for our measures and evidence
against the strong presence of method effects (conway &
lance, 2010). in addition, the scales for our predictors (mindfulness, safety behavior, and safety climate) and our outcome
(injuries) used different response scale anchors/formats (the
predictors indicated agreement, the outcome indicated frequency), which all help to reduce the likelihood of common
method bias (podsakoff et al., 2003). fourth, to support the
honest and open responding of our participants, our study
procedures strongly emphasized the confidentiality of the individual responses and that no individual data would be
shared with supervisors or organizational members.
reducing fears of the data being shared or used for organizational decisions can help decrease the likelihood of social
desirability responding (podsakoff et al., 2003). finally, to
assess the impact of common method bias on our results, we
performed confirmatory factor analyses using a marker variable. results from this supplementary analysis do not support
the presence of strong common method bias. overall, although the validity of our findings would be strengthened by
future research linking mindfulness and safety behavior to
objective indicators of injuries and accidents, we believe the
methods used in the current study are appropriate and still
provide initial support for the proposed model.
finally, in this study, we examine the role of trait mindfulness, which can be thought of as a dispositional tendency
towards active, non-judgmental, awareness (brown et al.,
2007; glomb et al., 2011). we purposefully examined trait
mindfulness within our study to build on the current research
on mindfulness in the workplace and provide <span style="background-color: yellow;">organizations</span>
with information on whether an employee’s mindfulness, in
general, could be used to help organizational performance,
regardless of the momentary situational and attentional demands that might influence the employee’s ability to be in a
mindful state. however, another conceptualization of mindfulness is state mindfulness, or the variation of mindfulness
from moment to moment that is typically highest during meditation practices (e.g., robins, keng, ekblad, & brantley,
2012; sedlmeier et al., 2012). by looking at trait mindfulness
instead of state mindfulness, we were unable to assess how
mindfulness in a particular moment is related to behavioral
decisions and injury occurrence. instead, our study shows that
dispositional tendencies towards mindfulness are associated
with general higher levels of safety behaviors across situations. now that we have established this link between trait
mindfulness and safety, expanding on our findings by
zooming in to look at the episodic relationships between state
mindfulness, subsequent self-regulation, and safety behavior
is an interesting next step for this research, with broad implications for interventions that target promoting mindfulness
during safety critical encounters.
conclusion
using multi-level data from employees within safety-critical
positions, this research develops theory surrounding the influence of trait mindfulness on accidents/injuries and the mechanisms and moderators associated with this relationship.
overall, our results highlight mindfulness as an important predictor of accidents/injuries and suggest that, particularly in
work groups with strong safety climate, the promotion of trait
mindfulness could be a useful tool for increasing employee
safety behaviors and, ultimately, decreasing accidents/injury
occurrences.
